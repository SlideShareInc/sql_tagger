= sql_tagger

+sql_tagger+ is a gem that inserts comments into SQL queries. These comments
include a string from <tt>Kernel#caller</tt> that (hopefully) reveals what Ruby
code was responsible for performing the query.

To use this, just require the appropriate file. For example, to use this with
the +mysql+ gem, perform <tt>require 'sql_tagger/mysql'</tt> instead of
<tt>require 'mysql'</tt>.

Before:
    SELECT 1
After:
    /* program.rb:25:in `some_method' */ SELECT 1
